This repository contains projects about mixture models

In this project, I critically evaluate the properties and performance of a mixture regression
model on a standardized claims data set containing information relating to the claims history of
branches within an insurance company. The records are aggregated to the branch level and it has
the following variables:
1. Y = Claims - Total claims cost
2. X1 = Beneciaries - Number of beneciaries in the branch
3. X2 = Age - Average age of members
4. X3 = Pens Ratio - Ratio of pensioners to the total number of members
5. X4 = Female Ratio - Ratio of female beneciaries to the total number of members
6. X5 = Depen Ratio - Average dependency ratio per policy


Final R code ----- assignment 3 Final.R
